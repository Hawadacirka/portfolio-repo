### My process
It is my portfolio that I made it with my skills. The background was just colour but I changed my mind. I put the image background that suited the colour. 
I chose green as the main colour because I liked the plants. I added the side colours into my portfolio that makes unique with green. I tried not to get too much excessive colours.

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Google Alternatives like icons/font family

### What I learned
It took me a few months to understand HTML/CSS/JS. 
I can not say it is easy but I am processing. I find it very hardest is to creat the code.
I would make my style ideas into the web, the small part goes sometimes out of hand.
Then it starts messing up all the code. But it stops me not, I figured it out why the code doesn't work and changed it a lot. I like finding it out that how and why happenend. It gives me envilened.

### Continued development
I am still beginnner but I did it all by searching on the internet and getting information their code explaintion that how the code works. 
Any encounter I will be trying to do my best to solve it. 
For the future, I would to do a few frameworks to gain my new skills and working on it like the projects.
